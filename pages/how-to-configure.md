In the Check Variant, you can change the Check attributes:

## Remote Checks

* Code Pal is required in the Remote Check System only;
* Profiles are allowed, but you have to assign them to the RFC user.

You can use the **Remote Code Inspector** or the **Remote ATC**. 

### 1. Remote Code Inspector

Having the `Reference Check System` set under `SCI` > `Code Inspector` > `Management Of` > `Reference Check System`, you can create a Check Variant using the `In Reference Check System` option.

In the Remote Check System, you can create and configure the Check Variant and Code Pal Profile, as mentioned before.

### 2. Remote ATC
